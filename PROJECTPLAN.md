# Final Project Plan - Overview

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to use the `llava-phi-3-mini` model (in GGUF format) to develop a `llamafile` image-text application. 

## Model Information

**Llava-phi-3-mini**:
- Finetuned from Microsoft's 3.8B parameter Phi-3-Mini-4K-Instruct model and OpenAIâ€™s CLIP (clip-vit-large-patch14-336).

## Motivations

- Build out a `llamafile`.
- Learn more about CLIP and its applications in zero-shot image classification and other tasks.

## Timeline

### Week 1: Initial Project Planning
- Define project scope and objectives.
- Set up the project repository and documentation structure.

### Week 2: CLIP/ Zero-Shot Image Deep Dive Research
- Conduct an in-depth study on CLIP.
- Understand the principles of zero-shot learning.
- Review relevant research papers and existing implementations.

### Week 3: Convert Llava-phi-3-mini Model to Llamafile
- Convert the `llava-phi-3-mini` model to the `llamafile` format.
- Ensure compatibility and functionality.
- Document the conversion process.

### Weeks 3-4: Testing Llamafile
- Test the converted `llamafile` for accuracy and performance.
- Refine and debug as necessary.

### Weeks 5-7: Design and Build Out Web Application
- **Week 5**:
  - Brainstorm features of the web application.
  - Determine the scope of interactivity and extensiveness based on time constraints.
- **Weeks 6-7**:
  - Design the user interface and user experience.
  - Develop the frontend and backend of the web application.

### Weeks 8-9: Dockerize and Build Out CI/CD Pipeline
- **Week 8**:
  - Start with Dockerizing the application.
  - Set up the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
- **Week 9**:
  - Refine Docker setup and CI/CD processes.
  - Ensure seamless deployment and updates.

### Week 10: Final Testing and Submission
- Conduct thorough testing of the entire application.
- Finalize documentation and prepare for submission.
- Submit the completed project.
